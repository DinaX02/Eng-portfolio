          <p className="paragrafo_tocare_context">
          Population ageing brings health and long-term care challenges, increasing the demand for assistance in institutions, home and hospital environments. Formal and informal carers are essential, but they face difficulties in coordinating with family members and health professionals, which can compromise the quality of care and affect their well-being. <br></br> <br></br>The platform aims to support these carers, improving coordination between those involved and relieving work overload.

          <p  className="paragrafo_origens">
          Carers of elderly people face significant difficulties in communicating and coordinating tasks effectively with other carers. <br></br><br></br>This inefficiency in exchanging information and organising daily activities compromises the quality of care provided, increasing the stress and burden on carers.</p>

          <p className="paragrafo_tocare_context">
          Recognising the existence of problems associated with coordination between carers, we propose the creation of a mobile application that aims to revolutionise elderly care in the form of an innovative, user-centred solution.<br></br><br></br>
          As a tool to help manage the day-to-day lives of the elderly, the application allows carers to record and monitor daily tasks such as administering medication, bathing and changing nappies.

          The application aims to facilitate the coordination of care between different providers.<br></br><br></br>
          By integrating biometric data and promoting effective communication between carers and health professionals, the aim is to improve the quality of care provided, reduce errors and relieve the burden on carers, contributing to the well-being of all those involved.
