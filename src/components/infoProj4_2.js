            We want to be the start of a new way of using and sharing clothes
            that gives everyone the opportunity to feel good about the clothes
            they wear in the most affordable and sustainable way possible. We
            envision leading a radical change in the fashion industry, making it
            more sustainable and accessible for everyone. We want to inspire a
            change in mentality, making fashion synonymous with environmental
            responsibility.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            We aim to be the main reason why fewer clothes are wasted by
            establishing practices that extend the life of quality garments. In
            doing so, we want not only to redefine fashion choices, but also to
            create a global community committed to conscious consumption.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>Our future is one where every piece tells a story of
            positive impact on the world.
